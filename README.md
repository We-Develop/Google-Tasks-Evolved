Google-Tasks-Evolved
====================

The Google Tasks Evolved extension is a fork of Better Google Tasks and provides a better interface to display google tasks in Chrome. It uses the “canvas” view in a popup to allow more detailed control over tasks as well as single-click access to any task list. In addition, it displays a count of unfinished tasks from ALL task lists (not just the default task list) in the taskbar.
